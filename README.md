# YouReply Backend

Welcome to the YouReply backend repository! YouReply is an AI-powered YouTube
comment assistant built to enhance viewer interactions for content creators.
We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our backend development.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the YouReply backend, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [backend-repo-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd youreply-backend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Follow the following ENV Config

## Environment Configuration

To run the YouReply backend, you need to set up a `.env` file with various
configuration variables. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your backend project.

2. Define the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

   - `PORT`: The port on which the backend server will run (e.g., `PORT=3000`).

   - `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection string for your database.

   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name.

   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key.

   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret.

   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth 2.0 client ID.

   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth 2.0 client secret.

   - `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`: Your YouTube Data API key.

   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

   - `[Other Variables]`: Include any other environment-specific variables your
     backend requires.

3. Save the `.env` file.

Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version
control. It should contain sensitive information that should not be exposed.

## Example .env File

Here's an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/your-database
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-youtube-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will be available at http://localhost:your-port.
