# YouReply Backend

Welcome to the YouReply backend repository! YouReply is an AI-powered YouTube
comment assistant built to enhance viewer interactions for content creators.
We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our backend development.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the YouReply backend, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [backend-repo-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd youreply-backend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Follow the following ENV Config

## Environment Configuration

To run the YouReply backend, you need to set up a `.env` file with various
configuration variables. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your backend project.

2. Define the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `NODE_ENV`: The environment mode for your application (e.g.,
  `NODE_ENV=development`).

- `SITE_URL`: The URL of your site (e.g., `SITE_URL=http://localhost:8000`).

- `DOMAIN`: The domain name and port (e.g., `DOMAIN=localhost:8000`).

- `PORT`: The port on which the backend server will run (e.g.,
  `PORT=your-port`).

- `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI for your database (e.g.,
  `MONGODB_URI=mongo-atlas-uri`).

- `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your JWT access token for authentication (e.g.,
  `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-jwt-access-token`).

- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`:
  Configuration for Cloudinary integration (e.g.,
  `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key`,
  `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret`).

- `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CALLBACK_URL`: OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google
  authentication (e.g., `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id`,
  `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret`,
  `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CALLBACK_URL=your-callback-url`).

- `NODEMAILER_EMAIL`, `NODEMAILER_PASSWORD`: Configuration for Nodemailer (e.g.,
  `NODEMAILER_EMAIL=your-nodemailer-email`,
  `NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your-nodemailer-password`).

- `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS`: The number of salt rounds for bcrypt password hashing
  (e.g., `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=10`).

- `OPEN_AI_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `AI_API_KEY`: OpenAI organization ID and API key
  (e.g., `OPEN_AI_ORGANIZATION_ID=your-openai-org-id`,
  `AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`).

3. Save the `.env` file.

Make sure to replace `your-port`, `mongo-atlas-uri`, `your-jwt-access-token`,
`your-cloud-name`, `your-api-key`, `your-api-secret`, `your-client-id`,
`your-client-secret`, `your-callback-url`, `your-nodemailer-email`,
`your-nodemailer-password`, `10`, `your-openai-org-id`, and
`your-openai-api-key` with your actual configuration values.

Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version
control. It should contain sensitive information that should not be exposed.

## Example .env File

Here's an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```env
NODE_ENV=devlopment
SITE_URL=your-site-url(http://localhost:8000)
DOMAIN=localhost:8000
PORT=your-port
MONGODB_URI=mongo-atlas-uri
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-jwt-access-token
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_CALLBACK_URL=your-callback-url
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=your-nodemailer-email
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your-nodemailer-password
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=10
OPEN_AI_ORGANIZATION_ID=your-openai-org-id
AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
